## Overview
This project demonstrates how to classify handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset** and **Scikit-learn**. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The goal is to build a simple yet effective machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9).

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Load the MNIST dataset using Scikit-learn.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize pixel values and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Train a Logistic Regression model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set.
- **Visualization**: Display sample predictions with their true and predicted labels.
